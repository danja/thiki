ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* .idea/
* .idea/.gitignore
* .idea/libraries/
* .idea/libraries/libs.xml
* .idea/libraries/libs2.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* LICENSE.md
* LICENSE_PREVIOUS.md
* README.md
* ic_launcher-web.png
* litter/
* litter/meta.ttl
* proguard-project.txt
* thiki.iml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/androjena_0.5.jar => app/libs/androjena_0.5.jar
* libs/commons-io-2.4.jar => app/libs/commons-io-2.4.jar
* libs/dropbox-android-sdk-1.2.2.jar => app/libs/dropbox-android-sdk-1.2.2.jar
* libs/httpmime-4.0.3.jar => app/libs/httpmime-4.0.3.jar
* libs/icu4j-3.4.5.jar => app/libs/icu4j-3.4.5.jar
* libs/iri-0.8.jar => app/libs/iri-0.8.jar
* libs/json_simple-1.1.jar => app/libs/json_simple-1.1.jar
* libs/markdownj-core-0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar => app/libs/markdownj-core-0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar
* libs/slf4j-android-1.6.1-RC1.jar => app/libs/slf4j-android-1.6.1-RC1.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
